# Webinar videos and exercises

Here you can find the exercise set for each webinar along with the video lectures and additional useful materials.

The recorded webinars can be found [here](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/N93MsxAG1QwZX8G).

__Important__: the code for the exercises is in Jupyter Notebooks that should be accessed with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). When you open the Notebook on GitHub on the very top of the document you will see a button 'Open in Colab'. Clicking it will open the current Notebook in Colab for you. You can run and modify the code directly from there, but in order to save your changes you should either 
 * be signed into your Google account, in which case you can save the modified Notebook to your Google Drive
 * have a valid GitHub account, in which case you can save a copy of your modified Notebook to an exisiting GitHub repository of yours

Within the Colab environment you can use GPUs to run your code. For this go to Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU. Please note that the sessions are limited in time. That means every 12 hours you will be disconnected from your current session. You can restart it, but all your local data and variables will be lost, meaning that you will have to load the data and run all the Notebook cells again.
