## Exercises:
 * Notebook 1 - image_manipulation. In this notebook we will work with the data from Kaggle Data Science Bowl competition. We will load the data, display the images and apply various transformations available in cv2 library. 
 * Notebook 2 - ReadingData. In this notebook, we first will read images and their corresponding labels and then will wrap and save them in a single file on disk (or google drive). It helps us a lot later to avoid reading so much data each time when we are working with our models. We will use the python pickle module to wrap images in a single file.

## Python courses:

Please note that you will __NEVER__ learn any programming language by reading or watching videos. You need to __CODE__, the more - the better.
